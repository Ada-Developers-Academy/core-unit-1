## Expressions: Everything Becomes a Value

In programming, an **expression** is a unit of code that can be evaluated into one value.

We use expressions mainly to get a _value_.

The following are examples of expressions, because when our code runs, these turn into one value.

| Expression        | Value                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `42`              | `42`                                    |
| `800 + 900`       | `1700`                                  |
| `"Hello, World!"` | `"Hello, World!"`                       |
| `True`            | `True`                                  |
| `999 > 0`         | `True`                                  |
| `999 <= 0`        | `False`                                 |
| `999 == 0`        | `False`                                 |
| `my_list[0]`      | The first element of the list `my_list` |

### !callout-info

## Function Calls are Expressions

For functions, we can interpret a function call used as an evaluated value as an _expression_.

### !end-callout

## Statements

In programming, a **statement** is a unit of code that contains an action to execute.

We use statements mainly to _perform an action with side effects_.

The following are examples of statements.

| Statement                 | Side Effect                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `foo = "A value for foo"` | Assigns the variable `foo` to a value                               |
| `return foo`              | Exits a function, and optionally returns a value                    |
| `if` statements           | Begins a conditional clause                                         |
| `pass`                    | Statement to say "there is nothing to execute on this line of code" |

Many of these statements use syntax that will be covered more in-depth with deeper knowledge.

## Values Have Data Types

Every value in Python has a data type.

### Built-in Data Types

This is a list of all data types available in the Python programming language.

| Data Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Integer          | Represents an integer! A whole number that is positive, negative, or zero.                                                                                   |
| Float            | Represents a number that isn't whole; it is fractional, or has a decimal place.                                                                              |
| String           | Represents text, specifically with an ordered sequence of characters.                                                                                        |
| Boolean          | Represents true or false.                                                                                                                                    |
| None             | Represents the concept of no value, or the absence of a value.                                                                                               |
| List             | An ordered list of values. Items in the list are sometimes called elements. Can get the value of an item by using square brackets and the index of the item. |
| Dictionary       | An unordered collection of key-value pairs. Can access values in the dictionary by using square brackets and the name of the key.                            |
| Range            | A sequence of numbers between a start, stop, and incrementing by a step.                                                                                     |
| Tuple            | An ordered, unchangeable collection of items.                                                                                                                |
| Set, frozenset   | An unordered collection. Cannot access values with index or key; must use a loop.                                                                            |
| bytes, bytearray | A collection of binary digits (bits).                                                                                                                        |

### !callout-info

## Explore Data Types

We will not go into depth with tuples or sets in this curriculum, but they are interesting and useful data types. You are free to learn more and apply them; follow your curiosity!

### !end-callout

### Get the Data Type with `type()`

If we're ever unsure about what the data type of a value is, we can use Python's built-in method `type()` to read the data type.

We use the method like this:

```python
type( expression_to_get_the_type_of )
```

Examples:

```python
print(type("This is a string!"))
print(type(6789 * 100))
print(type(3.3))
print(type(["do", "re", "mi"]))

my_bicycle_details = {
    "frame_color": "red",
    "num_of_wheels": 2,
    "grip_tape_color": "turquoise"
}
print(type(my_bicycle_details))
print(type(my_bicycle_details["num_of_wheels"]))
```
Prints the following:
```
<class 'str'>
<class 'int'>
<class 'float'>
<class 'list'>
<class 'dict'>
<class 'int'>
```

### Casting

We can convert a value to a different data type.

We can use these methods to convert a value into another data type

- `int()`
- `float()`
- `str()`
- `bool()`

```python
my_lucky_number = 7
my_num_as_float = float(my_lucky_number)
my_num_as_str = str(my_lucky_number)
my_num_as_bool = bool(my_lucky_number)

print(my_num_as_float) # prints 7.0
print(my_num_as_str)   # prints 7
print(my_num_as_bool)  # prints True

my_lucky_fraction = 3.33
my_fraction_as_int = int(my_lucky_fraction)

print(my_fraction_as_int) # prints 3
```

### !callout-info

## Experiment with Casting

Often times, the behavior of converting isn't very predictable. What happens when we cast an empty list into a string? Or an integer into a boolean? It is best to experiment with converting in a REPL before using it in code.

### !end-callout

## Literals Are The Thing Itself

In programming, a **literal** is a way to write a value that is the value itself. If the value _looks_ the same as its value, then it is a literal.

```python
"This string is a string literal, because this string is literally a string."
```

This is in contrast to variables, which have a value, but are not the value itself, nor are they written as the value itself.

```python
my_string = "Hello, world!"
```

The string `"Hello, world!"` and the variable `my_string` both have the same value. However, they differ in how the value is written. `"Hello, world!"` is a string literal because what we see is literally what the value is. `my_string` does not _look_ like what its value is. `my_string` is not _literally_ the string `"Hello, world!"`.

```python
my_dict = {
    "bananas": 1,
    "mangos": 2
}
```

The dictionary `{"bananas": 1, "mangos": 2}` is a dictionary literal because it looks like its value. The variable `my_dict` refers to a dictionary as its value, but isn't a dictionary literal.

## Printing and Formatting Strings

Often times, we want to combine strings and non-string expressions.

Python allows us to combine these by making **f-strings.** These strings have a prefix of `f` at the beginning, and evaluate any expression that is contained in `{}` curly braces.

```python
f"The string to format and include Python syntax, where expressions inside curly braces turn into a value!: {2 + 3}"
```

We can observe these examples:

```python
print(f"The sum of 2 + 3 is {2 + 3}")
# prints "The sum of 2 + 3 is 5"

pineapples = "mY pInEaPpLe mEsSaGe"

print(f"Here is {pineapples}!")
# prints "Here is mY pInEaPpLe mEsSaGe!"
```

There are many other ways to combine strings and non-string values. Some methods include concatenation, or the `format()` method. Feel free to research these and use them; follow your curiosity!

An expression is a piece of code that evaluates to a value.  In the conditional `if` statement, what is the portion that evaluates to `True` or `False`?

##### !end-hint
##### !explanation

In the `if` statement, `test_num > 10` will evaluate to `False`.  It is the expression that is being evaluated in the statement.
