# Intro to Computer Memory

## Goal

The goal of this lesson is to introduce computer memory. We believe this introductory content will help us better understand the machines we work on.

## Introduction

Computers are machines that carry out sequences of operations. We call these sequences of operations programs. Programs tell a computer what operations to perform, in what order, and on what data. The instructions of a program, its operations and data, are loaded into a part of the computer called memory.

What does it mean when our [Activity Monitor](https://support.apple.com/guide/activity-monitor) says a program takes 100% CPU utilization? What do we mean when we say "memory"? Knowing a bit more about what's going on inside a computer can help us be more comfortable when we sit down to write programs.

## Vocabulary and Synonyms

- CPU
- RAM
- Volatile memory

## CPU

At the heart of a computer is the CPU, or Central Processing Unit. We sometimes simply call it the processor. Modern computers have _many_ kinds of processors, but the CPU is the main one that generally does the most work.

The CPU is a physical bunch of electronic circuitry located in a small package on the main board, or **motherboard**, of the computer. We can think of it as many tiny gates that let specific patterns of electricity flow along very precisely defined paths (that are etched with light!). By controlling the gates, and altering the flow of the electricity, the CPU does something very important: it executes instructions from software.

The CPU is amazing! Even though all it does is direct the flow of electricity through its circuitry, this lets it perform basic math, logic, control, and data read and write operations. By combining these simple operations with well-designed software (that _we_ are going to write!), the CPU can carry out even the most complex tasks!

## Physical Memory

The CPU will process many instructions that require data to be stored.

Physical memory devices hold this data. Like the CPU, physical memory is itself a package of electrical circuits. It holds the patterns of electricity that the CPU interprets as data. The CPU uses physical memory by writing data to it and reading data from it.

## RAM

RAM, or Random-access memory, is a form of computer memory. RAM sticks are physical memory devices that attach to a motherboard. RAM has two unique traits compared to other forms of computer memory:

1. RAM is fast
1. RAM holds data temporarily

RAM is fast! For one, it's directly connected to the CPU. And no matter the address, the CPU can access any location in RAM in the same amount of time. Imagine being able to access a room on the top floor of a skyscraper just as quickly as a room near the front door! This property is what the "random-access" part of RAM describes.

## Sequential Access Memory

In contrast to RAM, there is another memory configuration called SAM, or sequential access memory. It is less common these days, and is most typically used as long-term storage, often in the form of magnetic tape. It's referred to as "sequential" because if we need to access some data stored in the middle of the tape, we must inspect the tape sequentially, from the beginning, until we reach the data of interest. Compared to RAM, it's relatively inexpensive, high capacity, and _very_ slow.

### !end-callout

RAM holds data temporarily. When a computer turns off, and no more power is supplied to the RAM sticks, RAM stops holding memory. RAM holds data temporarily, and can't be used for long-term data storage. We refer to this data impermanence as being "volatile."

If RAM is fast, but volatile, what do we use RAM for?

### How the CPU Uses RAM

The CPU is responsible for running computer programs. When we start a program, first it gets copied into RAM. Then the CPU starts fetching instructions from the RAM containing the program code. As it carries out those instructions, it will also use RAM to read and write the temporary data the application needs while it's running.

Modern CPUs are very fast, and need a lot of data to stay busy. As a result, the CPU will end up accessing RAM billions of times every second! Fortunately, the connection between the CPU and RAM is direct and dependable, allowing this incredible system to operate reliably.

### Memory Versus Storage

We've discussed that the memory we call RAM is responsible for storing instructions and data while a program is executing. There are other parts of a computer that are responsible for holding that data when a program _isn't_ actively running. Somewhat confusingly, modern devices sometimes refer to this as memory too, but it is better described as **storage**, where data can be kept for the long-term. A common example of this is a hard disk drive in a computer.

## Memory in Action

When we write a program, we place the code in a Python file. That Python file and any code or data inside of it is stored in our hard drive. When we run the program, the file is copied from the hard drive to RAM and any data created while running the program such as variables, the result of computations, etc. is stored in RAM. The data created while running the program is not automatically saved anywhere once the program stops or we turn off our computer.

Say, for example, we run a program that finds all mentions of 'Ada Lovelace' in a text file. To save the program's findings, we would have to store the results somewhere, such as a file on our hard drive or the web. Follow your curiosity if you are interested in learning more about how web or cloud storage works.

### Metaphor Pt 1: RAM As the Countertop

To illustrate the difference between memory and storage, we can compare a computer to a kitchen.

The CPU is the chef. _RAM_ (memory) is countertop space. Long-term storage is a pantry, fridge, or recipe box.

The chef is limited in how much they can do at once by their countertop space, which is for putting things temporarily while doing something with them.

## Memory Addresses

Memory devices organize the data it stores by having and using **memory addresses**.

Each piece of data in memory occupies a memory location, which has an assigned memory address that the CPU can use to locate it.

### Metaphor Pt 2: The Countertop With Numbered Bins

![A countertop with all our ingredients in organized bins](../assets/intro-to-dev-environment_intro-to-computer-memory_mise-en-place.jpg)

To illustrate how the CPU uses memory addresses to temporarily put and locate instructions and data, let's continue to compare a computer to a kitchen.

Again, the CPU is the chef and RAM is countertop space. The CPU chef organizes their countertop space (memory) into labeled and numbered bins.

When they want to prepare a meal (run a program), they pick a recipe card from their recipe box, get the ingredients from the pantry and fridge, and place the recipe card and ingredients in the numbered bins on the counter. If they were making pancakes, then the recipe card might go in bin 1 so they can easily see it, and the milk, eggs, flour, etc. could go in bins 2, 3, 4, and so forth.

The CPU chef prepares the pancakes by consulting the recipe card, then taking and combining each ingredient in the counter space in front of them according to the directions.

Maybe the CPU chef works in a restaurant kitchen, and an order for waffles also comes in. If there's room in the counter top bins, they can go find the recipe card for waffles, again gather the ingredients, and place them in another set of bins at the counter.  Maybe this time, the recipe is in bin 11, and the waffle ingredients are placed in the bins starting with bin 12, then 13, and so on.

## Mise en place

Does this sound like a strange way of cooking to you? The practice of laying out all the ingredients needed for a recipe is called [_mise en place_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place) (pronounced [meezahn plahs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyJZeZpPdVw)) and helps a chef keep things organized if they are expecting to cook a variety of dishes!

### !end-callout

The CPU chef can prepare multiple recipes at the same time, as long as there is still space on the counter and in the bins. They can follow each recipe, a little at a time, taking out ingredients from the bins, and putting them back again when done.
