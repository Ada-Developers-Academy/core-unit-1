##### !question

Voice assistants like Alexa will turn on when their 'wake word' is announced nearby. Which option best describes this behavior?

##### !end-question
##### !options

* 
``` Python
if "alexa" in users_speech and "echo" in users_speech:
  print("processing your request...")
```
* 
``` Python
if "alexa" in users_speech or "echo" in users_speech:
  print("processing your request...")

if "alexa" == users_speech or "echo" == users_speech:
  print("processing your request...")

##### !end-options
##### !answer

* 
``` Python
if "alexa" in users_speech or "echo" in users_speech:
  print("processing your request...")
```

##### !end-answer
##### !hint 

`users_speech` is a string. 

##### !end-hint

##### !explanation

Alexa software requires at least one wake word in order to turn on and process requests. The `or` ensures that `print("processing your request...")` will execute if EITHER alexa or echo is used. `and` would require the user to say "Alexa echo" in order to turn on Alexa.
