## Expressions: Everything Becomes a Value

In programming, an **expression** is a unit of code that can be evaluated into one value.

We use expressions mainly to get a _value_.

The following are examples of expressions, because when our code runs, these turn into one value.

| Expression        | Value                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `42`              | `42`                                    |
| `800 + 900`       | `1700`                                  |
| `"Hello, World!"` | `"Hello, World!"`                       |
| `True`            | `True`                                  |
| `999 > 0`         | `True`                                  |
| `999 <= 0`        | `False`                                 |
| `999 == 0`        | `False`                                 |
| `my_list[0]`      | The first element of the list `my_list` |

Callout: For functions, we can interpret a function call used as an evaluated value as an expression.

## Statements

In programming, a **statement** is a unit of code that contains an action to execute.

We use statements mainly to _perform an action with side effects_.

The following are examples of statements.

| Statement                 | Side Effect                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `foo = "A value for foo"` | Assigns the variable `foo` to a value                               |
| `return foo`              | Exits a function, and optionally returns a value                    |
| `if` statements           | Begins a conditional clause                                         |
| `pass`                    | Statement to say "there is nothing to execute on this line of code" |

Many of these statements use syntax that will be covered more in-depth with deeper knowledge.

Callout: For functions, we can interpret a function call used execute a change as a statement.

## Values Have Data Types

Every value in Python has a data type.

### Built-in Data Types

This is a list of all data types available in the Python programming language.

| Data Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Integer          | Represents an integer! A whole number that is positive, negative, or zero.                                                                                   |
| Float            | Represents a number that isn't whole; it is fractional, or has a decimal place.                                                                              |
| String           | Represents text, specifically with an ordered sequence of characters.                                                                                        |
| Boolean          | Represents true or false.                                                                                                                                    |
| None             | Represents the concept of no value, or the absence of a value.                                                                                               |
| List             | An ordered list of values. Items in the list are sometimes called elements. Can get the value of an item by using square brackets and the index of the item. |
| Dictionary       | An unordered collection of key-value pairs. Can access values in the dictionary by using square brackets and the name of the key.                            |
| Range            | A sequence of numbers between a start, stop, and incrementing by a step.                                                                                     |
| Tuple            | An ordered, unchangeable collection of items.                                                                                                                |
| Set, frozenset   | An unordered collection. Cannot access values with index or key; must use a loop.                                                                            |
| bytes, bytearray | A collection of binary digits (bits).                                                                                                                        |

Callout: We will not go into depth with tuples or sets in this curriculum, but they are interesting and useful data types. You are free to learn more and apply them; follow your curiosity!

### Get the Data Type with `type()`

If we're ever unsure about what the data type of a value is, we can use Python's built-in method `type()` to read the data type.

We use the method like this:

```python
type( expression_to_get_the_type_of )
```

Examples:

```python
print(type("This is a string!"))
print(type(6789 * 100))
print(type(3.3))
print(type(["do", "re", "mi"]))

my_bicycle_details = {
    "frame_color": "red",
    "num_of_wheels": 2,
    "grip_tape_color": "turquoise"
}
print(type(my_bicycle_details))
print(type(my_bicycle_details["num_of_wheels"]))

# Output:
# <class 'str'>
# <class 'int'>
# <class 'float'>
# <class 'list'>
# <class 'dict'>
# <class 'int'>
```

### Forcing a Data Type

We can convert a value to a different data type.

We can use these methods to convert a value into another data type

- `int()`
- `float()`
- `str()`
- `bool()`

```python
my_lucky_number = 7
my_num_as_float = float(my_lucky_number)
my_num_as_str = str(my_lucky_number)
my_num_as_bool = bool(my_lucky_number)

print(my_num_as_float) # prints 7.0
print(my_num_as_str)   # prints 7
print(my_num_as_bool)  # prints True

my_lucky_fraction = 3.33
my_fraction_as_int = int(my_lucky_fraction)

print(my_fraction_as_int) # prints 3
```

Callout: Often times, the behavior of converting isn't very predictable. What happens when we cast an empty list into a string? Or an integer into a boolean? It is best to experiment with converting in a REPL before using it in code.

## Literals Are The Thing Itself

In programming, a **literal** is a way to write a value that is the value itself. If the value _looks_ the same as its value, then it is a literal.

```python
"This string is a string literal, because this string is literally a string."
```

This is in contrast to variables, which have a value, but are not the value itself, nor are they written as the value itself.

```python
my_string = "Hello, world!"
```

The string `"Hello, world!"` and the variable `my_string` both have the same value. However, they differ in how the value is written. `"Hello, world!"` is a string literal because what we see is literally what the value is. `my_string` does not _look_ like what its value is. `my_string` is not _literally_ the string `"Hello, world!"`.

```python
my_dict = {
    "bananas": 1,
    "mangos": 2
}
```

The dictionary `{"bananas": 1, "mangos": 2}` is a dictionary literal because it looks like its value. The variable `my_dict` refers to a dictionary as its value, but isn't a dictionary literal.

## Printing and Formatting Strings

Often times, we want to combine strings and non-string expressions.

Python allows us to combine these by making **f-strings.** These strings have a prefix of `f` at the beginning, and evaluate any expression that is contained in `{}` curly braces.

```python
f"The string to format and include Python syntax, where expressions inside curly braces turn into a value!: {2 + 3}"
```

We can observe these examples:

```python
print(f"The sum of 2 + 3 is {2 + 3}") 

pineapples = "mY pInEaPpLe mEsSaGe"

print(f"Here is {pineapples}!") 

# Output
# "The sum of 2 + 3 is 5"
# "Here is mY pInEaPpLe mEsSaGe!"
```

There are many other ways to combine strings and non-string values. Some methods include concatenation, or the `format()` method. Feel free to research these and use them; follow your curiosity!
