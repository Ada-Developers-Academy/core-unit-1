Define a class named `Pokemon`.

- At initialization, `Pokemon` takes in three arguments: a name, a "primary type," and a "secondary type."
    - For example, this creates an instance of `Pokemon`: `Pokemon("Gengar", "ghost", "poison")`
- There are three attributes on each `Pokemon` that should be set to the correct values:
    - `name`
    - `primary_type`
    - `secondary_type`

Create a class named `BasketballTeam`, which fulfills the following requirements:

- Has one attribute, `members`, which starts as an empty list in the constructor
- Has an instance method named `add_member`

Create a class named `Automobile`, which fulfills the following requirements:

- Takes in one parameter in its constructor for the initial speed, which is an integer
- Has one attribute, `speed`
    - The attribute `speed` should have the value of the initial speed passed in
- Has an instance method `accelerate`
    - Has one parameter, which is an integer that is the amount to change speed by
    - Increases the `speed` attribute by the argument
    - Returns `speed`

The following code should be able to work successfully with the `Automobile` class.

```python
bus = Automobile(45)

bus.accelerate(5)

print("The speed of the bus is 50:", bus.speed)

bus.accelerate(-2)

### !question

Use the following definition of `BasketballTeam`. Each `BasketballTeam` has:

- An attribute `score_dict`, which maps a member's name to the number of points they've scored
- An instance method `get_total_score`, which goes through the values of `score_dict` and sums and returns the total number of points

Read through this example code to see what usage of `score_dict` could look like:

```python
original_scores = {
    "Charly": 12,
    "Rahma": 12,
    "Gillian": 12
}
green_team = BasketballTeam(original_scores)

print("I can get Charly's score:", green_team.score_dict["Charly"])

print("I can get the team's total score, which is 36:", green_team.get_total_score())
```

Create an instance method named `requires_overtime`.

This method should:

- Take in one argument, which is a number of points from an opposing basketball team
- Compare this team's total score against the opposing score:
    - if the two scores are equal, return `True`
    - if the two scores aren't equal, return `False`
- **Required**: Use the `get_total_score` instance method
    - Invoke it with `self.get_total_score()` inside `requires_overtime`

### !question

Use the following definition of `Automobile`. Each `Automobile` has:

- An attribute `speed`, which is an integer
- An instance method `accelerate`, which adjusts the `speed` based on the given speed delta

Read through this example code to understand `Automobile` better:

```python
bus = Automobile()
bus.speed = 45

bus.accelerate(5)

print("The speed of the bus is 50:", bus.speed)

bus.accelerate(-2)

print("The speed of the bus is 48:", bus.speed)
```

Create an instance method named `adjust_to_speed_limit`.

This method should:

- Take in one argument, which is a speed limit
- **Required**: Use the `accelerate` instance method
    - Invoke it with `self.accelerate()` inside `adjust_to_speed_limit`
- Follow the rules of this table:

| If ...                                        | Then...                               |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Current `speed` is under `speed_limit` by 5+  | accelerate with a speed delta of `2`  |
| Current `speed` is under `speed_limit` by 1-4 | accelerate with a speed delta of `1`  |
| Current `speed` is equal to `speed_limit`     | Don't change speed                    |
| Current `speed` is over `speed_limit`         | accelerate with a speed delta of `-1` |

### !question

Given this definition of `BasketballTeam`, implement the `get_leading_team` function.

This function must:

- Take in two arguments: an instance of `BasketballTeam` as `home_team`, and another instance of `BasketballTeam` as `away_team`
- If the score of `home_team` is greater than or equal to `away_team`, return `home_team`
- Otherwise, return `away_team`
- **Required**: Use the instance method `get_total_score` on `home_team` and `away_team`

The following code should be able to work successfully with the `get_leading_team` function.

```python
green_team = BasketballTeam("Green Team", {
    "Charly": 12,
    "Rahma": 12,
    "Gillian": 12
})
yellow_team = BasketballTeam("Yellow Team", {

    "Lilly-Ann": 100
})

leading_team = get_leading_team(green_team, yellow_team)

print("Leading team is the yellow team:", yellow_team.team_name)
```

Note that `get_leading_team` is _not_ inside of the `BasketballTeam` class. To solve this problem, you do not need to alter the code in `BasketballTeam`.

An example of a working implementation:

```python
def set_traffic_speed(vehicles, target_speed):
    for vehicle in vehicles:
        vehicle.set_speed(target_speed)


class Automobile:
    def __init__(self):
        self.speed = 0

    def set_speed(self, new_speed):
        self.speed = new_speed
```
