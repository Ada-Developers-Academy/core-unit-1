# What is OOP?

## Learning Goals

- Define what Object-Oriented Programming is as a programming paradigm

## Introduction

A paradigm is a set of ideas that support a specific perspective. Programming paradigms are large concepts that focus on particular approaches to problem solving.

_Imperative programming_ is a programming paradigm that says programmers should solve problems by defining instructions for a computer to follow. You've programmed in the imperative programming paradigm if you've ever thought, "In order to solve that problem, I need to write down what steps a computer needs to take first, then second, then third."

_Object-oriented programming_ is a programming paradigm that is a subset of imperative programming that focuses on how we arrange and operate on data.

We can classify entire programing languages according to the programming paradigms they emphasize.

## Object-Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that encourages structuring data as **objects.**

Objects are _things_ that represent concepts as data, hold their own distinct state, and carry out behaviors related to the concept they represent.

Objects are the primary building blocks for problem solving in object-oriented programming languages like Python.

Python lets us create objects that represent concepts like numbers, text, lists, the idea of true and false, and more. Even concepts that we define ourselves! Each of these ideas is represented as a different data type.

For example, Python defines `int` and `float` data types to represent certain kinds of numbers. The `str` (string) data type represents text, which is a bunch of letters, strung together. When we need to work with conditions that can be true or false, the `bool` (Boolean) data type has us covered.

Each of these data types:

- represents a different, specific idea as data
- has particular behavior that is meaningful to its concept

For example...

- Integers
  - represent whole numbers
  - can be subtracted with another integer or float
- Strings
  - represent text
  - can be concatenated (joined) with other strings
- Booleans
  - represent true or false
  - can be negated—true becomes false, while false becomes true

### Defining Classes

Beyond using Python's built-in data types, we can define our own data types.

To define our own data type, we create a **class.** A **class** is code that defines a template for creating similar objects.

Each class definition will have:

- A class name
  - This name is used as the "data type" name
- **Attributes**
  - An attribute is a piece of data
  - A class definition holding an attribute means we expect this class to hold a specific piece of data
- **Methods**
  - A **method** is a function that describes behavior or action

| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| A class that describes the idea of a sequence of text                                                          | str        |
| A class that describes an ordered list                                                                         | list       |

### Creating Instances of Classes

An **instance** is a concrete, literal manifestation of a class.

A _class_ defines the plans for a data type, much like a template, blueprint, or recipe. It determines the initial—or base—state, and the behaviors of that data type. The class definition is used to build instances.

An _instance_ is a single example of a class. The class provides the recipe to bake a cookie and the instance is the actual cookie (in its physical and yummy form)! Class instances, like other pieces of data, allocate and use memory, and have concrete state and behavior.

In our code, after a class is defined, we can create one instance, 50 instances, or thousands of instances. All of these instances will be distinct from one another, because they can all hold different attributes, and each occupies a different place in memory.

## Examples: Instances of Classes

Observe these examples of classes that already exist, or classes that could exist.

| Class  | One Instance of the Class                      | Another Instance of the Class                     |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| str    | `"Hello World! I am an instance of a String!"` | `"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog."` |
| list   | `["red", "orange", "yellow"]`                  | `["June", "July", "August"]`                      |
| Driver | A driver with a driver ID of `DR0004`          | A driver with a driver ID of `DR0005`             |
| Album  | Dirty Computer (2018)                          | Purple Rain (1984)                                |

#### Synonyms for Creating Instances

Creating instances is something we'll do a lot, almost as much as making variables or using loops. There are a lot of ways to say that we're creating an instance.

We might say...

- I'm making an instance of an `Album`. This instance represents one album, named "Purple Rain."
- I'm creating an instance of `Album`. This instance represents one album, "Purple Rain."
- I'm instantiating the `Album` class. Now I have an instance, which is "Purple Rain."
- I'm making an `Album` object. The `Album` object is the "Purple Rain" album.
- The "Purple Rain" instance of `Album` is very different from the "Dirty Computer" instance of `Album`.
- "Purple Rain" and "Dirty Computer" are both instances of `Album`.

### State and Behavior

When we start defining our own classes, we will specify two main things: their **state** and their **behavior**.

In the context of Object-Oriented Programming, **state** is used to refer to all the variables packaged within a class and **behavior** is used to refer to all the functions packaged within a class.

### Attributes and Methods

There are two more words we will often see in the context of OOP: **attribute** and **method**.

For whatever reason, engineers long-ago decided we needed new words to describe variables and functions that make up a class's state and behavior. 

An **Attribute** is a specific kind of **variable**: one defined within a class. Similarly, a **method** is a specific kind of **function**: one defined within a class.

These four words (state, behavior, attributes, and methods) aren't introducing anything new. Instead, they let us talk about things we already know (variables and functions) in a new context (being in a class)!

## Summary

In OOP...

We represent an idea as a data type by defining a **class.** A class is a template, or blueprint of the idea. The class is where we define the idea's possible **state** and **behavior.**

After we define the idea by defining a **class**, we use this class to create examples, or **instances** of the class. These instances are also known as **objects.**
