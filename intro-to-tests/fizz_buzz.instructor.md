# Instructor: TDD Ping Pong

## Goals
- Demonstrate TDD workflow and the Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Demonstrate writing Unit Tests with Pytest

## Resources
The live code repo: [TDD Ping Pong /Fizz Buzz](https://github.com/AdaGold/tdd-ping-pong).

## Guidelines
The suggested way to run this live code is one instructor writes a test and then the other instructor implements code to make the test pass. The second instructor then writes the next test.

A `requirements.txt` is not currently provided. Here are a few suggestions for how to run this exercise related to the `requirements.txt`.
- We could not use venv and use the globally installed pytest for this exercise
- We could use venv and install pytest and create a requirements.txt
- We could create a `requirements.txt` in the repo and model creating a venv and installing the requirements

In C15 and C16 we introduced `requirements.txt` and `venv` with the first project.
