# Instructor: TDD Exercise

## We are no longer using replit for livecodes and activities

Current Repo (introduced in C22): [https://github.com/Ada-Activities/tdd-exercise](https://github.com/Ada-Activities/tdd-exercise)

Replit Activity: [https://replit.com/@adadev/tdd-exercise#README.md](https://replit.com/@adadev/tdd-exercise#README.md)

Replit Solution: [https://replit.com/@adadev/tdd-exercise-solution](https://replit.com/@adadev/tdd-exercise-solution)

The TDD Exercise is introduced as part of the problem set (Part 1) and parts 2 and 3 are meant to be a classroom activity. This classroom activity likely needs 2 hours.

Many folks are not familiar with BlackJack. Hopefully by providing the prompt as part of the problem set students will have time to review the rules.
    - If not knowing the rules of blackjack proves to be an impediment to the learning goals, we should probably replace the prompt for this exercise.
